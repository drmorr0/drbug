# drbug
x86 debugger written in Rust -- I'm following along with Sy Brand's [Building a Debugger](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger)
book, translating into Rust instead of C++.  I have no idea what I'm doing, so obviously it goes without saying that you
shouldn't use this for anything real (right now).
